It didn't actually use https when required.

== 0.2 2008-1-19 All together now release

This is a big release, where we have merged the efforts of various parties into one common library. This means there are definitely some API changes you should be aware of. They should be minimal but please have a look at the unit tests.

== 0.1.2 2007-12-1

== 0.1.1 2007-11-26

* 1 First release as a GEM
  * Moved all non rails functions into this GEM from the Rails plugin http://code.google.com/p/oauth-plugin/
